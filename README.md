## Project Review
I chose to use Next.js because I thought it would be fun to learn a new technology I've been meaning to learn and complete the code challenge. I think my initial approach to the project was wrong, initially I wanted to go for a pixel perfect recreation of the mockup file but I think that was a mistake. After thinking about it for a little bit I changed my approach to getting the design close to the mockup and using the power of Next.js to add some extra functionality. Overall I am very happy with how this project turned out.

Some of the things I would like to look into given more time would be the image load times, I think I have minified the images as much as possible but some of them still take a second to load before the website is cached. There are some glitches with the font where it looks like a chunk gets cut off for some reason, I'm not entirely sure why that is. Lastly I would like to research project structure for Next.js a little bit more and see if how I did it was a reasonable way to do it or if there are better ways to structure and organize your projects.
