## Project Review
I chose to use Next.js because I thought it would be fun to learn a new technology I've been meaning to learn and complete the code challenge. I think my initial approach to the project was wrong, initially I wanted to go for a pixel perfect recreation of the mockup file but I think that was a mistake. After thinking about it for a little bit I changed my approach to getting the design close to the mockup and using the power of Next.js to add some extra functionality. Overall I am very happy with how this project turned out.
